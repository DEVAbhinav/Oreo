            "paragraph": ["Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is a famous university located in Varanasi, India. It was established in 1916 by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, who was a well-known leader and educationist in India. He worked with Annie Besant, another famous leader, to create this university.","The idea behind BHU was to provide high-quality education in India so that Indian students wouldn't have to go abroad for their studies. Malaviya believed that it was important for Indian students to understand and appreciate their own culture and traditions while also learning about modern science and arts. He wanted the university to combine modern and traditional education.","BHU was different from other universities of its time because it was a residential university. This means that students would live on the campus while studying. Most other universities in India at that time only conducted exams and awarded degrees, but didn’t have a campus where students lived and attended classes.","The university's main campus is located near the Ganges river and covers over 1,300 acres. It has a lot of buildings that are designed in a beautiful Indo-Gothic style. The campus has more than 65 hostels where over 12,000 students can live."]
